INTRODUCTION
============
jGL Unofficial (jgl-core) is an unofficial fork of jGL, a 3D graphics library
that doesn't require video cards or native libraries.

jGL is a 3D Graphics Library for Java* programming language with an API which
is similar to that of OpenGL**. jGL has not supported all the OpenGL functions,
but the usually used ones.

This fork removes all AWT dependencies and most of GUI-related GLUT functions.
This change makes it possible to use jGL under the places where AWT is missing
such as text-consoles or Android***.

This fork is compilable with 6u45 with Java 1.4 target.
I think it's still compatible with real Java 1.4 SDKs,
because this fork doesn't use any new features from Java 1.5 or 1.6.

MAIN CHANGES
============
*Package name changed from "jgl" to "com.github.nullnoname.jgl.core".
 This is done because this fork is not API compatible with the original.

*There are no GLCanvas, GLApplet, or jgl.glut.glut_menu in this fork.
 They are removed because of heavy AWT dependencies.

*GUI related functions are removed, mainly from GLUT.

*To initialize the screen you can use glXMakeCurrent:
     myGL.glXMakeCurrent(null, 0, 0, width, height);

*GL.getImageBuffer() is added in order to access the screen buffer.
 You can create MemoryImageSource by using it:
     new MemoryImageSource(width, height, myGL.getImageBuffer(), 0, width);

*The original jGL printed all error messages to System.out.
 This fork adds a logger class (JGLLogger) and sends errors to it instead.
 By default all error messages are sent to System.err, but you can change it
 by writing your own JGLLogger implementation and pass it to GL constructor:
     new GL(new YourJGLLogger());

HOW TO COMPILE THE SOURCE CODES
===============================
Unlike original jGL it doesn't use Makefiles. This fork uses Maven instead.
Setup JDK and Maven, then execute "mvn package".
Alternatively, just import whole source into your IDE; it doesn't
contain any third-party dependencies.
